# kNN in Python
An implementation of the k-NN learning rule as an algorithm for classification in Python. Classification is performed on the MNIST dataset, consisting of handwritten digits in the form of images of 28 by 28 pixels withpixel intensities taking values in {0, 1, ... 255}. The images are accompanied by a ”true” label in {0, 1, ..., 9}. The data set is partitioned in training andtesting subsets and for the first couple of questions we will use a smaller sampleof the training and testing subsets to limit computation time.
